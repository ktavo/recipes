The Caprese (tomato, basil, fresh mozzarella and balsamic vinegar) combination is one of the worlds best ingredient combinations…and then you add avocado into the mix and things get totally crazy. When I make a Caprese dish, more often then not lately you’ll also find some perfectly ripe avocados in the mix of things, because why not? Avocados are healthy, they’re creamy, they have a mellow yet incredible flavor, and they pair perfectly with tomatoes, basil and mozzarella. Pile all of that over some garlicky skillet chicken and finish it of with a generous drizzling of balsamic glaze and you’ve got an chicken dish worthy of a holiday meal…yet it’s easy enough for a weeknight meal! You can have this chicken ready in 20 – 25 minutes (especially if you slice the toppings while the chicken cooks)! Does dinner get any better? Really, I’m not sure it does. I was savoring each and every bite of this delicious chicken!
